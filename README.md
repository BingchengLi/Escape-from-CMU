# Escape-from-CMU
15-112 term project! Created in **Dec 2021**.
~~I really wanted to escape from this school back then~~

Escape From CMU is a 2D single-player platforming video game that stimulates the process of escaping from Carnegie Mellon University. The game is written in `Python`.

I implemented random terrain generation, maze generation, and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm -- ***first "big" project in my life***!

## How to Play
15-112 provides a module that integreats PIL/Pillow and Requests. To run the game, first download [cmu_112_graphics.py](https://kosbie.net/cmu/fall-21/15-112/notes/cmu_112_graphics.py) and be sure it is in the same folder as the file you are running. And then, just run `main.py` to start.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Professor Mike Taylor, Professor David Kosbie, the best mentor Jerry Wang, and my friend Zara Mansoor.
